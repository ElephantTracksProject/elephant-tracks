--Building--

1. Set the variables as approprriate in Makefile.inc
	a. ASMJAR must point at the jar for ASM
	b. Java path should point to a jre
	c. INSTALL_DIR is where the resulting binaries will end up.
	d. You probably won't need to change any other options, but this is still beta software...  :)

2. make; make install; 
        
        Now the binaries will be wherever you set INSTALL_DIR
 
--Running--

1. Be sure that libElephantTracks.so and libHashGraph.so are in a directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH  (they will be located in INSTALL_DIR)
2. Run java with some complicated paramters:


java -Xbootclasspath/a:<INSTALL_DIR> -agentlib:ElephantTracks=javaPath=<path to Java>`:outputFile=<Output File>:classReWriter=<INSTALL_DIR>/elephantTracksRewriter.jar

       The program trace will be in <Output File>.  Doing the tracing will slow down program execution considerably; on the order of 500-1000 times slower.
